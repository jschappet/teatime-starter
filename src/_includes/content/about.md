## Introduction

### About Us

Welcome to "ReVillage Society," where we invite you to embark on a journey personal transformation through relationship with yourself, partner(s) and community. Our story is one of rediscovery, growth, and the pursuit of living life on our own terms.

### Our Vision

We believe that community is a practice. 


Our vision is simple yet profound: to empower individuals, couples and community to embrace their authentic selves, awaken their desires, and create the lives they truly desire. We believe that through the fusion of sacred sexuality and conscious manifestation, a world of boundless possibilities awaits.

### Meet Genevieve and Schappet

Genevieve and Schappet, the authors of "Erotic Couples Manifesting." Our journey of self-discovery began after a significant life event—a divorce that marked the end of a 20-year marriage. It was a turning point that forced me to reevaluate my life and make intentional choices.

We have learned that life's greatest power lies within us—the power to shape our own destinies. By taking responsibility for my health, exploring sacred sexuality, and shedding societal expectations, we have ignited a transformation that reshaped our bodies, minds, and relationship.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to share our experiences, insights, and practices with you. We want to inspire you to break free from stagnant routines, rewrite your narrative, and build connections that nourish your soul. We're here to guide you on your path to sexual liberation, self-discovery, and the conscious creation of your desires.
