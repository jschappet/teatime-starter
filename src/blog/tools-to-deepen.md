## Intro 
Stepping into the realm of relationship deepening is akin to entering a sultry dance floor, where the challenges are as tantalizing as they are rewarding. Picture a dance of communication that's not just a conversation but a seductive exchange of desires. Trust-building becomes an intoxicating tease, and conflict resolution is a heated tango of passion. In this spicy exploration, we uncover five tantalizing tools designed to set the stage on fire, promising to turn the connection between partners into a sizzling, irresistible affair. Get ready for a journey that goes beyond the ordinary, igniting the flames of desire and forging a connection that's as hot as it is profound. Let the seduction of deepening your relationship begin!

Welcome to the spicy realm of desire exploration, where the heat is turned up, and boundaries are set ablaze. As Jennifer aptly puts it, this is the real deal, and let's face it - none of us are naturally adept at it. So, what's this thrilling challenge? It's the electrifying game of uncovering your needs and desires, a realm where authenticity reigns supreme.

You and your partner stepping onto the sultry stage of desire exploration. The first tool in this blazing adventure is simple yet profound – a game from the world of Authentic Relating. Brace yourselves for a tantalizing journey where you acknowledge the bigness of your desires, throw perfection out the window, and give yourselves permission to play.

Here's the game plan: Choose who takes the lead, set the timer for 3-7 minutes, and let the desire dance commence. Yes/no questions and requests become the seductive whispers in the air:

- "Would you take out the trash?"

- "Will you hold my hand?"

- "Do you like vanilla ice cream?"

- "Can I bite your neck?"

Desires laid bare, questions sizzling with anticipation. After the timer's sultry countdown, take 3 minutes to revel in the aftermath. Reflect on the experience – as the seeker, did the yes feel like a victory, the no like a challenge? As the responder, did you sense the answer in your body or was it a tantalizing thought?

But wait, the game doesn't end there. Switch roles, restart the timer, and let the desire tango continue. As the flames of exploration flicker, consider spicing things up with alternatives: 

- The responder can only say "no."

- Make the requests the name of the game.

- Ask for something to be done to/for you, turning desire into action.

So, ignite the fire, embrace the game, and let the desires flow. This is your relationship, after all, and what's a spicy connection without a little dance of desire? Get ready to play, reflect, and report back on the passion that unfolds – because in this game, everyone's a winner.

## Question Rating Game
Another, perhaps safer game, is to ask your partner questions and not get a yes or a no but instead a rating of the level of interest in answering the question. Ask any question at all and your partner will rate the question on a scale from 1-5. A question they really don't care about answering would be rated a 1. A question they are dying to answer right now and just keep talking about is a 5.

I like to slow down and wonder how well I really know my partner. I begin to think of questions and I can see speckled pieces of assumptions scattered throughout my thinking. The thought of testing my assumptions brings shivers up my back. How can I subtly communicate to him how much I love him? I turn my whole attention to his being, and begin to sort through memories and intuitions to see if I can guess what he will want to talk about. 

Will you tell me about the volcano you have been watching in the news?
He rates this a 3. He is interested but not super excited. Its informational.

Will you tell me about the car racing you like to watch?
Again, a 3. Again, its just information about a thing. 

Will you tell me about your life's purpose?
I win! He rates this question at a level 5 and wants to tell me right away.

What questions can you think of to ask your partner? How well do you know what they love? Can you learn something new?
