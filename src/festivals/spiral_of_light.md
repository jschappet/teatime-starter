summary: As we leave the time of harvest, Mother Nature is here to remind us that it is time to slow down, to spiral inward, and bring a quiet light into our heart and home. It is now time of stillness, a time to connect with the small voice of knowing in ourselves. As we do this, we also find comfort in the quiet presence of each other, in community.

As we leave the time of harvest, Mother Nature is here to remind us that it is time to slow down, to spiral inward, and bring a quiet light into our heart and home. It is now time of stillness, a time to connect with the small voice of knowing in ourselves. As we do this, we also find comfort in the quiet presence of each other, in community.

We are days away from the winter solstice, the longest night of the year. The days are colder and shorter. Bringing the light and life into our homes reminds us that soon the days we be getting longer again, the first buds of spring are many weeks away, but the light is already returning. The sunlight following it's own rhythm, closing out this season and bringing in the new.

We keep these stories and share them as a way to connect with the earth, our ancestors and each other during the coldest, darkest time of the year. This connection to our shared past can bring hope when the light is the lowest. 

Thank you Victoria for keeping this history alive and sharing it with all of us, so that we can rebuild our village together.
